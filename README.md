On the first page, you can see the Home page, which serves as my introduction. <br>
At the top of the page, specifically on the right-hand side, you’ll find links to all the sections of this project: Home (the current page), Projects , Articles , and Contact.<br>
At the bottom right corner, there’s a button labeled "Contactame aquí" (which means "Contact me here" in Spanish). If you click on it, it will open a link that allows you to send an email to a test email address.<br>
All the other pages share the same header and footer design.<br>
On the Projects page, if you hover your mouse over the projects, their colors will change. The same interactive effect applies to the next page, Articles.<br>
Finally, the Contact page includes a form where you can fill in your details to get in touch.<br>
Thank you for taking the time to read this!
